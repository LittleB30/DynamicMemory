# DynamicMemory
Create a C++ class named DoubleList that manages a dynamic array of doubles.
 
By default, the class must allocate space for 10 doubles when a new object is created. If a double is added and there's no room for it, the class must allocate space for an additional 10 doubles.
 
The class must include at least the following methods in addition to a default constructor:
addDouble (which adds a double to the end of the list)
removeDouble (which removes the last double in the list)
getDouble (which accepts an int parameter and returns the value of the double at that index) 
getNumDoubles (which returns the number of doubles actually in the list)

The class must be a "good" dynamic class, with a correct copy constructor, destructor, and assignment operator.
 
Name your class files DoubleList.h and DoubleList.cpp.
 
Also provide a test program that thoroughly exercises the class. You may name that file whatever you wish. Please follow naming instructions precisely, as I will be using a program of my own to test yours, and it will depend on your method, class, and file names matching the specifications.
